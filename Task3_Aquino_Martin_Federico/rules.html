        <b>IHF FIELD REGULATIONS</b>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>DIMENSIONS</strong>.IHF Law 1 provides for flexible external
            field dimensions within a given maximum and minimum width and
            length. These dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by
            teams under 12 and older.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>COMPETITION FIELDS</strong>. Fields used within the
            competition program must be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues,
            districts or associations participating in the state competition
            program that are unable to provide a field that meets these minimum
            requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will
            assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to
            the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should
            be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or associations that are
            unable to provide an acceptable field may be required to play all
            their games away.
